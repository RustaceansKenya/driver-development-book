# Prayer in C 

Low-level development is a broad and hard craft. The entry barrier is HARD.  
An entry-level dev needs to know SO MUCH. They need to have so many skills just to be considered employable.  


Rust has made low-level development easier. It is no-longer a craft reserved for experienced wizards.  
Rust has awesome docs. Awesome online Communities. Awesome tooling.  


But now the problem is in the industry. The African industry. The Kenyan industry.  

A junior dev...
- has no mentors. 
- has literally zero job prospects in rust-embedded or driver-development.  

They have no mentors because :  
- Kenyan tech is not hard-tech. There are few embedded/hardware/low-level companies in Kenya. Most are web & finance companies.  
- The few embedded companies that exist use C/C++/other
- The few embedded companies that exist do not major in embedded systems.  

The only way out is to build rust-based low-level companies and provide some form of employment & mentorship to all the junior devs.  
There are no senior devs to look up to. We have to be pioneers.  


We might get there some day.  
We can be pioneers.  

Or losers. ha ha
