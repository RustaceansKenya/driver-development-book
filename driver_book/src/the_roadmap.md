# The Roadmap  

The steps roughly look like this :
1. Learning how to read a datasheet.
2. Learning how to abstract info from a datasheet : this will be done both manually and with svd2rust
3. Getting an intro on no-std rust
4. Learning how to link, flash, debug and log chips.
5. Understanding the UART (theoretically)
6. Understanding the physical implementation of the UART according to the chip.  
7. Writing a simple driver that has a few functionalities.  
8. Performance measurement
9. No_std testing
10. Constant improvement... I guess... Adding more features, adding better API

The topics will not strictly stick to the implied order, the topics are intertwined.
