# Role 2: Providing an Interface

**TLDR**  
- Just provide a well-thought out API.  
- Err on the side of making communication between the kernel and the driver to be through message-passing.  
- Err on the side of exporting structures that implement singletons.  


[undone : Figure out how to write a clean driver-API, one that can be easily be reused in new drivers]
