# Role 2: Providing an Interface

The driver acts as an interface between the physical device and the kernel.  
In this case, the 'physical device' is inclusive of its internal firmware.  


The Driver abstracts the device as a simplified API.  
We will learn about HALs and PACs in future chapters. You can ignore them for now.  


{this is an undone chapter. Abstraction is an art. The author is still trying to find his rhythm.}  
{For devs with stable styles, you can edit this page.}
