# ABIs

## What is an ABI?  

An ABI (Application Binary Interface) is a set of specifications defining.... 

### Post runtime specs 
1. **Data representation**: How data types are represented in memory, including issues like endianness (byte order), alignment, and padding.  
2. **Object file formats**: The structure and layout of object files, which contain compiled code and data before they are linked into an executable. 

### Runtime specs
3. **Dynamic linking**: How dynamically linked libraries are loaded and resolved at runtime.  
4. **Function calling conventions**: How parameters are passed to functions, how return values are returned, and how functions are invoked.
