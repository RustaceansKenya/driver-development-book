### Newlib 
Newlib is a lightweight and efficient C library primarily designed for embedded systems and other resource-constrained environments. It provides standard C library functionality, including input/output, string manipulation, memory management, and more, while prioritizing small size and minimal overhead. Although it aims to offer POSIX compatibility, Newlib may not implement the full range of POSIX functions found in larger libraries like glibc. Suitable for standalone usage or integration into embedded development toolchains, Newlib serves as a practical choice for projects where conserving resources is paramount and where comprehensive POSIX compliance is not a strict requirement.

### glibc (GNU C Library): 
glibc is the standard C library for the GNU operating system and most Linux distributions.  
It provides comprehensive POSIX compatibility and a wide range of features, but it is relatively large and may not be suitable for embedded systems with limited resources.  

### musl libc:
musl is a lightweight, fast, and efficient C library that aims to provide POSIX compatibility with minimal overhead. It is designed to be small and suitable for embedded systems and other resource-constrained environments.
