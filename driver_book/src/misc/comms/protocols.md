# communication protocols

The UART is not the only physical communication protocol for serial communication. There are more modern alternatives, for example; 
1. USB (Universal Serial Bus)
2. SPI (Serial Peripheral Interface) 
3. I2C (Inter-Integrated Circuit)

Look into physical layer protocols like RS-232, RS-422, RS-485.  
What to look out for at the OSI physical layer protocol: 
1. Pin number
2. Pin configuration (information associated with each pin)
3. Transmission length
4. Error Handling techniques (parity-checking, differentials_btwn_voltages, ...)
5. Signal levels and associated power usage of the devices
6. Transfer speeds
7. Noise Immunity
8. Configuration process and its complexity (auto-config support, chances of misconfiguration)
9. Support of a limited number of connected devices (ep point-point vs multipoint vs broadcast-support)
10. Ergonomic :Plug-and-play functionality and widespread support.
