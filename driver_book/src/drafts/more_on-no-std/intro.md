# More on No-std.  

I would like to write code that has very few dependencies.  


The std-library is a dependency on its own. So I will avoid it whenever possible.  
The core-library, alloc and test crates are dependency free.  

This chapter just touches touches on these dependency-free library.  
These are short-notes, you are better off reading the complete & official docs.
