# Memory Symbols

This topic is undone

The memory symbols required by the core library are six: `memcopy`, `memmove`, `memset`, `memcmp`, `bcmp`, `strlen`. These are core memory routines which are generated by Rust codegen backends.  

The definitions of memcpy, memmove, memset, memcmp, bcmp, and strlen are listed as requirements because they represent commonly used memory manipulation and string operation functions that are expected to be available for use by generated code in certain contexts. While they are not strictly required for every Rust program, they are often relied upon by code generated by Rust's compiler, especially in situations where low-level memory manipulation or string operations are necessary.

Here are some reasons why these definitions are listed as requirements:

- Common Usage in Rust Code: While Rust encourages safe and high-level programming practices, there are still scenarios where low-level memory manipulation or string operations are necessary. For example, when interacting with foreign code written in C or when implementing certain performance-critical algorithms, Rust code may need to use these functions directly or indirectly.

- Interoperability with C Code: Rust often needs to interoperate with existing C libraries or codebases. These C libraries commonly use functions like memcpy, memset, and strlen. Therefore, ensuring that Rust code can call these functions or be called from C code requires that their definitions are available.

- Compiler Optimizations: Even if a Rust program doesn't explicitly call these functions, the Rust compiler may internally use them as part of optimization passes. For example, when optimizing memory accesses or string manipulations in Rust code, the compiler may choose to use these functions or their equivalents to generate more efficient machine code.
