# The Rust Compiler

This book is about writing code that runs on bare-metal machines. At one point, you may be writing code for a completely new ISA or custom runtime.  
So it makes sense to understand how you can use the Rust compiler to produce custom machine code.  


The best resources are the usual suspects :  
1. The Rustc Book. 
   Make sure you got a handle of the following selected chapters:  
   1. `Commandline arguments` chapter
   2. Under the `Platform support chapter`, read the `intro` and `Target Tier Policy` subchapter.
   3. The `Targets` chapter
2. The Embedonomicon


After you have got a grasp of the compiler's functionality, you might be tempted to learn more about LLVM or Cranelift in a bid to understand the Rust Compiler's implementation. You are highly encouraged to do so.
