# Bare Metal Programming

Drivers provide an interface for the OS to use, meaning that the OS depend on drivers... as a result, you have to write the driver code without the help of the OS-dependent Standard Library.  

Drivers do not depend on the standard library, they run on bare metal. Bare metal programming is the art of writing code that assumes zero or almost-zero hosted-environment.    

We will procedurally create a bare metal program in the next few sub-chapters.
