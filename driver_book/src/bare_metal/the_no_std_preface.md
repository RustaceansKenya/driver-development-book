# Bare Metal Programming

Bare Metal Programming !!!!!!!!!!  

Welcome to the first cool chapter!!! Wooooohooooo!!! Time to be one with the cold metal.   


I would really love to write more about this topic.  
It is THE FOUNDATION OF EVERYTHING in this book.  

I need to take time to put it in better words.  


However, [Philipp Oppermann's blog][writing-an-os-in-rust] covered this chapter very well. You can read it here üëáüèΩ: 
- Chapter 1 : [A Freestanding Rust Binary][a-freestanding-rust-binary]
- Chapter 2 : [A Minimal Rust Kernel][a-minimal-rust-kernel]  


It would be an understatement to call those 2 chapters legendary.
