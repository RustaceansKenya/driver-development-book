# Bare Metal Programming

Bare Metal Programming !!!!!!!!!!  

Welcome to the first cool chapter.  


[Philipp Oppermann's blog][writing-an-os-in-rust] covered this chapter very well. You can read it here 👇🏽: 
- Chapter 1 : [A Freestanding Rust Binary][a-freestanding-rust-binary]
- Chapter 2 : [A Minimal Rust Kernel][a-minimal-rust-kernel]  


It would be an **understatement** to call those 2 chapters legendary.
