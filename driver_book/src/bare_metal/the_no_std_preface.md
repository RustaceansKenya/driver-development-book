# Bare Metal Programming

Bare Metal Programming !!!!!!!!!!🥳🥳🥳🥳  
Welcome to the first cool chapter.  


Bare metal programming is the act of writing code that can run on silicon without any fancy dependencies such as a kernel.  

This chapter is important because both Firmware and Drivers are Bare-metal programs themselves.  



This chapter takes you through the process of writing a program that does not depend on the standard library; A program that can be loaded and ran on any board with a processor and some bit of memory... be it an arduino, an esp, a pregnancy-test-device or a custom board that you manufactured in your bedroom.    


[Philipp Oppermann's blog][writing-an-os-in-rust] covered Bare-metal programming very well. Philipp's blog covers the topic across two chapters, you can read them here 👇🏽: 
- Chapter 1 : [A Freestanding Rust Binary][a-freestanding-rust-binary]
- Chapter 2 : [A Minimal Rust Kernel][a-minimal-rust-kernel]  


It would be an **UNDERSTATEMENT** to call those 2 chapters legendary.  
Just go give them a read...
