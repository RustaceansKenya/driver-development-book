# Probing  

Probing is the act of interacting with the microcotroller via a debug adapter with the aim of doing at least one of the following... 
1. Flashing a compiled program onto the RAM or ROM of the microcontroller.
2. Performing some In-system programming
3. Debugging the running program
4. Testing the functionality of the microcrontroller

This chapter walks through the first 3 tasks while assuming that...  
- Your host machine is a linux box
- Your target machine is an esp32c3 SoC.  

This chapter has also been divided into two :  
- The theory behind probing
- The practicals
