# Probing Pracs

These pracs will take you through the process of ... 
- Configuring the interconnection between the host machine and the target board using udev
- Configuring gdb-to-openOCD-to-chip for the sake of flashing and debugging.
- Setting up defmt and RTT crate for chip monitoring and logging.
- Setting up a no-std testing framework

At the moment, this chapter is under development.  
So in the meantime, we will take a shortcut and use the esp-based tools that abstract away all the intricacies of manually setting things up.  

Manually setting things up is a good way to learn, but we will take a curve just this one time.
