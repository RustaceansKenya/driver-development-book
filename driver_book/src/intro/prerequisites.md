# Prerequisites for the Book

The prerequisites are not strict, you can always learn as you go:  
- Computer architecture knowledge : you should have basic knowledge on things like RAM, ROM, CPU cycle, buses...
- Rust knowledge : You don't have to be a generics or atomics guru. If you are okay with the topics covered before chapter 14 in the Rust book, then you are overqualified for this.  
- Have an esp32-c3. 
- Some interest in driver development.
