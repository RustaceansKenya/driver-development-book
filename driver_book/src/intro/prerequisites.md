# Prerequisites for the Book

The prerequisites are not strict, you can always learn as you go:  
1. Computer architecture knowledge : you should have basic knowledge on things like RAM, ROM, CPU cycle, buses... whatever you think architecture is.  
2. Rust knowledge : If you've read the Rust book, you should be fine. This doesn't mean that you should have mastered topics like interior mutability, concurrency or macros...these are things that you can learn as you go. Ofcourse, you will need them, but it's better to learn them on the job for the thrill of it.  


3. Have an esp32-c3... or any riscv board that you are comfortable with.  
4. Have some interest in driver development. Learning without interest is a mental torture. Love yourself.  


And finally, have lots of time and patience.  
Goodluck.
