# Prerequisites for the Book

The prerequisites are not strict, you can always learn as you go:  
- Computer architecture knowledge : you should have basic knowledge on things like RAM, ROM, CPU cycle, buses...
- Rust knowledge : You don't have to be a generics or atomics guru. You do not need to know concurrency... but it's something you will eventually need to learn in the course of the book. If you are okay with the topics covered before chapter 14 in the Rust book, then you are overqualified for this.  
- Have an esp32-c3. 
- Have some interest in driver development.
- Have lots of time. Driver development takes time... learning it for the fast time takes even more time.
