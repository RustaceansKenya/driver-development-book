# How Tasks get resolved

### Example 1 :  Person A was assigned task #1. 

so what does person A do?  

Person A gets busy as hell.  
Opens up a new branch.  
Fixes the issue.    
Writes a good commit message with the appropriate tags like in the [Conventional Commits guidelines][Conventional Commits guidelines] and finally creates a pull request that passes all checks.  

If the pull-request gets approved, the task will automatically change its status to 'done'. And the whole world will celebrate.

(undone)    


### Example 3 : Person A got assigned task #1. But Person A went MIA.
