# Intro  

Dear internet stranger, thanks for dropping by.  


You can contribute to this project by :
 - writing the driver code found at ['~/driver_code'][driver-code]
 - writing the driver crate-documentation found at ['~/driver_code'][driver-code]
 - writing the driver tutorial-documentation found at ['~/driver_docs'][driver-book-src]
 - writing ***THIS*** book that you are currently reading found at ['~/onboarding_book'][onboarding-book]


The hardest part about contributing to a new Open Source project is the steep-learning curve concerning 'contribution guidelines', 'Github and git magic', 'understanding the project management' and many other shenanigans. The hard part is usually not the code.  

So kindly help improve THIS book.
