# Tasks

A 'Task' is a fancy name for a Github 'issue'.   

## Where do tasks come from?

The maintainers create the initial tasks and post them as Github issues.  
The contributors can also create new issues/tasks and tag them appropriately. eg 'suggested-feature'-tag, 'bug' 'typo' ....

All tasks/issues automatically relect on the Project board.  

## How do tasks get assigned? 

There are 2 ways in which tasks get assigned...
1. The maintainers can assign tasks among themselves. 
2. A contributor can offer to take up on a task listed in the Project board. The contributor just needs to holla under the 'issue' comments. From there, the maintainer & contributor can discuss whatever the hell is there to discuss... before assignation.

## What about double implementations?  
I don't know meehh...
Contributors are adviced to only work on assigned tasks in order to avoid double implementations. Kindly communicate.  

## What about task sharing?
