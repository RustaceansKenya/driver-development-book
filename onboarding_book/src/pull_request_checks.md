# Pull Request Checks

Before a pull-request gets merged, it goes through some uniformity and quality checks.  
The scripts of those checks are implemented as github workflows found [here](undone).   

If your commits modified the driver-tutorial only, your pull request will undergo DOC_CHECKS that will be discussed in the next chapter.  
All Docs follow the [Official Rust-Doc style guide](undone).  


If your commits modified the driver-code and driver-crate-documentation, your pull-request will undergo CODEBASE_CHECKS that will be discussed in a later chapter.
