# DOC_CHECKS

The driver_docs have been written using [mdbook][mdbook-official-website]. The Mark-down used follows the [Rust-Doc style guide][rust-doc-style-guide].  

Currently, the only check is if your mdbook build runs well.  
Hopefully in the future, we will be able to enforce the style-guide-check... so for now, just faithfully stick to the guide... pretty-please 🥺🙏🏼🥰.  

The script for the DOC_CHECK can be found in the github workflows folder.
