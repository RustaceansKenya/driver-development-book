# DOC_CHECKS

The driver_docs have been written using [mdbook][undone] while following the [Official Rust-Doc style guide][undone].  

Currently, the only check is if your mdbook build runs well.  
Hopefully in the future, we will be able to enforce the style-guide... so just read the guide... pretty-please 🥺🙏🏼🥰.  

The script for the DOC_CHECK can be found in the github workflows folder.
