# driver-development-book
This book explains driver development using Rust. It does so by procedurally creating a UART driver for a RISCV chip.  
You do not need a physical chip to get through... but having one in the later chapters is highly encouraged so as to garner a more hands-on experience.  


### Why the UART?

The UART driver was chosen because it is simple and hard at the same time. Both the beginner and expert can learn a lot while writing it. For example, the beginner can write a minimal UART while the expert can write a fully fuctional concurrent driver. Because of this reason, a dev can iteratively work on this one project for a long time while improving on it and still manage to find it challenging on each iteration.  

Moreover, It is a driver that is needed in almost all embedded devices that require some form of I/O.  


The main aim here is to teach, not to create the supreme UART driver ever seen in the multiverse.
